In this project, I developed a **Movie Recommendation System** using **Python** and performed **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) 
in Jupyter Notebook. Further, built an Interactive web app with **Streamlit** and deployed it on **Heroku**, enabling users to receive personalized movie recommendations.

Heroku url: https://movie-recommendation-system-f692eaf1dc1b.herokuapp.com/  
Note: if the url doesn't, might have been removed by Heroku.

Please also note that this folder is missing the **similarity.pkl** file, which is needed to run the project, 
GitHub didn't allow it because of its high size.<br><br>
To download it(if you wanna try the project), use the **EDA Movie Recommender System Project.ipynb**.
